## Hey, I'm Hermes

I'm a senior engineer who accidentally fell into homelabbing after a trip to Japan in 2023.

What started as a quest to store trip photos without paying cloud subscription fees turned into a full-blown infrastructure project: Proxmox clusters, Kubernetes, hybrid cloud with Azure, enterprise networking, and now - AI automation experiments.

## What This Blog Is About

This is where I document:

- **Lessons learned** from building and breaking things
- **Infrastructure patterns** that work (or fail spectacularly)
- **Security practices** I enforce in my homelab
- **AI experiments** with local LLMs and automation
- **The inevitable escalation** that comes with every "small improvement"

## The Stack

```
├── Compute: Proxmox VE cluster (3 nodes)
├── Networking: TP-Link Omada SDN + OPNsense
├── Storage: Synology DS923+ (10TB)
├── Containers: Docker + Kubernetes
├── Automation: Ansible + GitLab CI/CD
├── Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
└── AI: Claude Code + local LLM experiments
```
